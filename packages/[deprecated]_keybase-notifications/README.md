# Keybase Build Notifications

This action allows you to post GitHub build notifications to [Keybase Chat](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-chat) channels, teams, and DMs. It sends messages via the [opensentinel API](https://www.opensentinel.com), using your `token` value.

## Using the Action

You will need an opensentinel automation API token in order to use this action. Create an account and go through the [Keybase setup information](https://www.opensentinel.com/docs/integrations/keybase). This action utilizes a **Generic Webhook** token.

For reference, opensentinel automation wbhook URLs for Keybase look something like:

```text
https://automations.opensentinel.com/webhook?token=<OSL_TOKEN>
```

### Build notifications for CI Tests

```yaml
name: "CI Tests"

on:
  push:

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: "Build & test"
        run: |
          echo "done!"

      # Add the notification step as the last one
      - uses: "marvinpinto/action-keybase-notifications@latest"
        if: always()
        with:
          job_status: ${{ job.status }}
          opensentinel_token: ${{ secrets.OSL_TOKEN }}
          on_success: "never"
          on_failure: "always"
```

This will send you a Keybase chat notification whenever a CI build fails but not when it passes (if you wanted to reduce channel noise). The `if: always()` stanza above ensures that the notification step [runs no matter what](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-status-check-functions).

### Build notifications for releases

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: "Build & test"
        run: |
          echo "done!"

      - name: "Deploy to production"
        run: |
          echo "+1"

      - uses: "marvinpinto/action-keybase-notifications@latest"
        if: always()
        with:
          job_status: ${{ job.status }}
          job_name: "Production Release"
          opensentinel_token: ${{ secrets.OSL_TOKEN }}
```

This will send you a notification message to let you know if the production release was successful or not.

## Parameters

| Parameter                | Description                                          | Default       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `opensentinel_token`\*\* | URL querystring value for token                      | `null`        |
| `job_status`\*\*         | GitHub Actions job status - use `${{ job.status }}`  | `null`        |
| `job_name`               | Display name to use in the chat message              | Workflow name |
| `on_success`             | When a build passes, notify you "always" or "never"? | `always`      |
| `on_failure`             | When a build fails, notify you "always" or "never"?  | `always`      |

### Notes:

- Parameters denoted with `**` are required.

## What about other GitHub events?

The opensentinel system itself handles other GitHub events directly. This action is primarily geared toward sending build + other ad-hoc messages.

This action will do its hardest to **NOT fail the build** as a result of a processing error (network/permissions/etc).

If you're still interested in receiving Keybase notifications for other GitHub events (`push`, `pull_request`, etc), set up a **GitHub Notification** webhook with [opensentinel](https://www.opensentinel.com/docs/handlers/github-notification) and add that to your repository.

## Filtering Notifications

You can cut down on chat noise by applying filters to events that trigger this action. For example, you can send a Keybase build notification only when someone pushes to the `master` branch.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

Read through the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) for advanced examples.

## Versioning

Every commit that lands on master for this project triggers an automatic build as well as a tagged release called `latest`. If you don't wish to live on the bleeding edge you may use a stable release instead. See [releases](../../releases/latest) for the available versions.

```yaml
- uses: "marvinpinto/action-keybase-notifications@<VERSION>"
```

## How to get help
